I found the following article interesting because of how it relates to the software engineering concepts discussed during lecture. Peter Seibel, then the tech lead of Twitter's software engineering effectiveness group, says that scaling up software is a delicate matter that can't be solved by simply assigning more engineers to a project. As a matter of fact, this approach may even hamper development efforts. Instead Seibel argues that a portion of a team should instead be devoted to developing tools and support software, in turn multiplying the effectiveness of the main team. He personally estimates that in a team of 100 engineers, two should be devoted to engineering effectiveness, while a much larger team of 10,000 from Facebook may need to devote a third of its workforce on support projects. Seibel also discusses the compounding effects of 'tech debt', a term where engineers implement a less-than-optimal solution to be improved upon when more time is available, and how support teams are specifically tasked at preventing this from happening.
